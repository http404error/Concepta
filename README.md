Our game.

To Do
--------
-Source Control (complete! could be optimized)/n
-Flying Player Character (mostly complete, need to iron out friction and downward movement)/n
-Floating Symbols (need to create a subclass of InterpActor which automatically matches the player's rotation, also textures need to be made)/n
-People (namely, behaviors and properties and player interaction)/n
-A map of some sort (terrain, textures, buildings, people)/n
-Victory conditions, hopefully multiple methods to win by/n
-Get custom Kismet Node scripts to work (for some reason they aren't showing up in the editor)/n
-Sound (at some point some soft music in the background, victory, defeat, and menu music would be nice along with little sounds to indicate a successful conversion or a failure)/n
-People (the people need meshes, materials, and animations)/n
-Map (buildings need textures and meshes, ground needs a texture possibly meshes(grass),  sky needs a texture)/n
-Menu (art, buttons)/n
-Splash Screen (something to show while game loads(art))/n
-Story (not to be implemented in the game but something that the team can use to all stay on the same page)/n
