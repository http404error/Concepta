Our game for OGPC 2013. Received Technical Award.

To Do
--------
-Source Control (complete!)<br />
-Flying Player Character (mostly complete, need to iron out friction and downward movement)<br />
-Floating Symbols (a subclass of InterpActor which automatically matches the player's rotation)<br />
-People (namely, behaviors and properties and player interaction)<br />
-A map of some sort (terrain, textures, buildings, people)<br />
-Victory conditions, hopefully multiple methods to win by<br />
-Get custom Kismet Node scripts to work (for some reason they aren't showing up in the editor)<br />
-Sound (soft background music, victory, defeat, and menu music would be nice along with little sounds to indicate a successful conversion or a failure)<br />
-People (the people need meshes, materials, and animations)<br />
-Map (buildings need textures and meshes, ground needs a texture, possibly meshes(grass),  sky needs a texture)<br />
-Menu (art, buttons)<br />
-Splash Screen (something to show while game loads)<br />
